[中文介绍](README.zh-CN.md)

FlowCore is a Rails engine to help you build your automation or business process application.

FlowCore modeling workflow with WorkflowNet (a special case of PetriNet) theory which is a generalisation of automata theory such that the concept of concurrently occurring events can be expressed.

You should try FlowCore if you need:

- Working on BPM, OA, CRM or other similar products
- Working on Airflow-or-n8n-like automation product
- Embeds in your Rails app, interact your codebase directly
- User defined workflow
- Jobs have dependent relationships, may running in different stages

## Features

### Support all databases which based on ActiveRecord

All persistent data are present as ActiveRecord model and not use any DB-specific feature.

### Easy to extend & hack

FlowCore basically followed best practice of Rails engine,
you can extend as [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html#improving-engine-functionality) suggests.

Your app-specific workflow triggers, callbacks and guards can be extended via [Single Table Inheritance](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#single-table-inheritance)

FlowCore also provides callbacks for triggers (which control behavior of a transition) covered whole task lifecycle.

### Petri-net based

[Petri-net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net) is a technique for description and analysis of concurrent systems.

FlowCore choose its special type called [Workflow-net](http://mlwiki.org/index.php/Workflow_Nets) to expressing workflow.

Compared to more popular activity-based workflow definitions (e.g BPMN),
Petri-net has only few rules but could express very complex case.

Check [workflow patterns](http://workflowpatterns.com) to learn how to use Petri-net expressing workflows.

### Basic workflow checking.

A workflow should be verified first before running it.

FlowCore provides the mechanism to help to prevent unexpected error on instance running

> This is the hard work and help wanted
> Workflow-net has [soundness](http://mlwiki.org/index.php/Workflow_Soundness) checking but I don't know how to implement it

### Interfaces and abstractions to integrate your business

FlowCore separate app-world and engine-world using interfaces and abstract classes,
basically you no need to know Workflow-net internal works.

### Runtime error and suspend support

FlowCore provides necessary columns and event callbacks for runtime error and suspend.

### A DSL to simplify workflow creation

FlowCore provides a powerful DSL for creating workflow.

## Demo

**You need to install Graphviz first**

Clone the repository.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/rails-engine/flow_core.git
```

Change directory

```sh
$ cd flow_core
```

Run bundler

```sh
$ bundle install
```

Preparing database

```sh
$ bin/rails db:migrate
```

Import sample workflow

```sh
$ bin/rails db:seed
```

Build Script Core

```sh
$ bin/rails app:script_core:engine:build
$ bin/rails app:script_core:engine:compile_lib
```

Start the Rails server

```sh
$ bin/rails s
```

Open your browser, and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Design

Architecture:

![Architecture](guides/assets/architecture.png)

Basic design based on [An activity based Workflow Engine for PHP By Tony Marston](https://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/workflow.html).

Some notable:

- Arc: The line to connecting a Place and a Transition
- ArcGuard: The matcher to decide the arc is passable,
            it's an base class that you can extend it for your own purpose.
- Task: A stateful record to present current workflow instance work,
        and can reference a `TaskExecutable` through Rails polymorphic-reference.
        It finish means the transition is done and can moving on.
- TaskExecutable: An interface for binding App task and FlowCore Task.
- TransitionTrigger: It controls the behavior of a Transition,
                     it's an base class that you can extend it for your own purpose,
                     best place for implementing business.
- TransitionCallback: It can be registered to a Transition, and be triggered on specified lifecycle(s) of Task

### Lifecycle of Task

- `created` Task created by a Petri-net Token
- `enabled` Transit to this stage when next transition requirement fulfilled
    - Best chance to create app task (your custom task for business) in `TransitionTrigger#on_task_enabled`
- `finished` Normal ending
    - Require app task finished first (if bind)
- `terminated` Task killed by instance (e.g Instance cancelled) or other race condition task

![Life cycle of workflow instance](guides/assets/life_cycle_of_workflow_instance.png)

### FlowKit

Because FlowCore only care about essentials of workflow engine,
I'm planning a gem based on FlowCore to provides BPM-oriented features, including:

- Dynamic form
- Approval Task with assignment
- ExpressionGuard

### Why "core"

Because it's not aim to "out-of-box",
some gem like Devise giving developer an out-of-box experience, that's awesome,
but on the other hand, it also introducing a very complex abstraction that may hard to understanding how it works,
especially when you attempting to customize it.

I believe that the gem is tightly coupled with features that face to end users directly,
so having a good customizability and easy to understanding are of the most concern,
so I just wanna give you a domain framework that you can build your own that just fitting your need,
and you shall have fully control and without any unnecessary abstraction.

## TODO / Help wanted

- Document
- Test
- Activity-based to Petri-net mapping that will possible to integrate to existing visual editors (with some modification),
  see <https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-mapping-between-BPMN-and-Petri-nets_tbl2_221250389> for understanding.
- More efficient and powerful workflow definition checking
- Grammar and naming correction (I'm not English native-speaker)

## Usage

> WIP

### Deploy a workflow

See [test/dummy/db/seeds.rb](test/dummy/db/seeds.rb) to learn the DSL, more complex sample see [test/dummy/app/models/internal_workflow.rb](test/dummy/app/models/internal_workflow.rb)

### Running a workflow

`workflow.create_instance!`

### Implementing an ArcGuard

[test/dummy/app/models/arc_guards/dentaku.rb](test/dummy/app/models/arc_guards/dentaku.rb) shows an expression guard which using [Dentaku](https://github.com/rubysolo/dentaku)

### Implementing a TransitionTrigger

[test/dummy/app/models/transition_triggers/timer.rb](test/dummy/app/models/transition_triggers/timer.rb) shows a delayed trigger which can be used for expires.

[test/dummy/app/models/transition_triggers/user_task.rb](test/dummy/app/models/transition_triggers/user_task.rb) shows a simple user task with a simple assignment.

### Implementing a TransitionCallback

[test/dummy/app/models/transition_callbacks/notification.rb](test/dummy/app/models/transition_callbacks/notification.rb) shows a simple callback that notify the assignee when the task started

### Implementing a TaskExecutable

[test/dummy/app/models/user_task.rb](test/dummy/app/models/user_task.rb) shows a sample,
[test/dummy/app/models/approval_task.rb](test/dummy/app/models/approval_task.rb) shows how to set payload to task that use for ArcGuard

### Extending Workflow

[test/dummy/app/models/internal_workflow.rb](test/dummy/app/models/internal_workflow.rb) shows how to use STI extending Workflow.

[test/dummy/app/overrides/models/flow_core/workflow_override.rb](test/dummy/app/overrides/models/flow_core/workflow_override.rb) shows how to apply Rails override pattern to extend base model,
here I add `to_graphviz` for dummy app visualize workflows.

## Requirement

- Rails 6.0+
- Ruby 2.5+

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "flow_core"
```

Or you may want to include the gem directly from GitHub:

```ruby
gem 'flow_core', github: 'rails-engine/flow_core'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install flow_core
```
